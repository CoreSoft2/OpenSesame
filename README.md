# This is OpenSesame.

2018-04-06

This is the new dev branch of OpenSesame. This is where I'll work
on bringing OpenSesame up to date for 2018 and beyond. Things to fix
in no particular order:

 - Support PyQt5
 - Switch to PyCharm IDE
 - Support current OpenVPN
 - Support current versions of Windows*


If/when I get it working again, I'll release a v1.5. Until then,
good luck!


* I actually develop on Linux, but I don't really plan to
  support it. Screw MacOS.
